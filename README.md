This is an old project I made years ago for the sake of learning some of the math behind 3D rendering, and to see if I could implement it from scratch without the use of standard grapgical libraries.
Python was chosen for its convienence, as the project was ment to be more of a learning experiance than an optimized 3D showcase.
Tbe program runs and renders everything in console.

Control:
  WASD, Left-Shift, and Space to move camera position
  Arrow keys to change camera angle
  C to destroy looked at object
